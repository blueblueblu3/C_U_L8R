## Overview:

The internet has changed a lot over the last 20 years, becoming a more commercial space ruled by large platforms, aesthetically becoming more homogenous. 
Early social sites (e.g. MySpace or Tumblr) allowed users to fully customise their profiles, giving them another avenue to express themselves. Blingee was a site that allowed users to create their own custom-made gifs, which would then be posted to other sites. 
These sites are slowly disappearing, losing a countless amount of data in the process. For example, last summer Blingee shut down its website, MySpace has been in a broken “read only” mode since 2024 and Tumblr had large staff layoffs on April. 
Contrary to popular belief, these sites, and the digital subcultures born within them, are extremely fragile. Platforms have the power to shut them down and lose all content in an instant. This has inspired users to start archiving their blogs and personal pages. 

 
Using my archive as a case study, I have created a shareable touchdesigner workflow that allows a user to experience their archive in an alternative way, as an audio-visual presentation. The user just has to plug in a folder with their archive (can be composed of images, gifs, video or http sites) and a .mp3 file, the program remixes the rest. 
Taking inspiration form internet content and aesthetics of the 2000s, this workflow remixes and reinvigorates an archive, taking it beyond being a folder in a computer and turns it into an experience. 

## Intro: 

There’s a misconception about the eternal nature of things uploaded to the internet. In reality, it is a fragile ecosystem that can disappear in an instant. Everyday, a countless amount of “born online” content gets lost. It’s an issue so well established, that a whole practice exists around it. Digital preservation is a formal process, with well defined parameters and initiatives. Institutions such as universities, companies or even governments have invested time and resources into these initiatives. 

The internet has changed a lot over the last 20 years, becoming a more commercial space ruled by large platforms. This change is also reflected on the aesthetics of “the internet.” Sites before where more customisable and chaotic, users had control over not only the content, but how it was displayed. Nowadays, platforms have a more streamlined appearance, relying on grids and a timeline. The user now only has (some) control over the content they post, and they must adapt the content to the platform they post it to. 

Aesthetics, such as blog themes, were an important factor in these digital social settings, since a user could customise their pages to better show who they were and what their interests were.
Users would not only bond over content, but also through the presentation of that content.

As a case study, I looked at three platforms that encapsulate this “2000s internet” ethos: **MySpace, Blingee and Tumblr**
These three platforms are more blogging adjacent (users have their own personal page that they can customise and post to) and have a high degree of customisability. 
Blingee was a bit more particular, it provided a specific service for users to create blingees. A blingee is a animated “sticker” that a user would create through layering different images and gifs. Users would then post the blingees they made to their profile. Blingees could be exported as gifs and would be frequently posted to MySpace and Tumblr. The site often organised contests where users would have to create a blingee with a specific theme. Blingees encapsulate a lot of this 2000’s internet aesthetic. 

Unfortunately these sites are slowly dying or are dead already; on June 2024, Blingee shut down it’s site. In 2019, MySpace lots all content from before 2016 due to a faulty server migration; the site has been in a “read only” mode since October 2024, with a lot of media and music that is unplayable or broken. 
Tumblr still remains active and functioning (with 7.3 million daily posts), but there were large staff layoffs in April of this year. Users of the site expressed concern over the site shutting down when the news were announced. 

When these sites go down, a countless amount of data is gone, and digital subcultures are lost. We can catch glimpses into what these sites were like though archived pages (thanks to services like The Internet Archive or archive.today) but we cannot see the whole picture. We can see what it was like, but we cannot feel what it was like. 

Being aware that a site could disappear at some point has inspired users to download their sites, creating accidental archives of online subcultures. 
I tested this with my own blog, archiving the las six years of content into a 4GB folder in my desktop. So what now? 

## The workflow: 

Using TouchDesigner, a visual programming language for real-time, interactive multimedia content, I designed a workflow that allows a user to experience their personal archive in an alternative way, as an audio-visual presentation of sorts. The user needs to plug in a folder with their files (which can be composed of images, gifs and video or .http files) and a audio file for the program to work. The program then takes the media from the file and displays it in sync with the selected audio. 
Since this project is inspired by 2000s digital aesthetics, I added a glitter overlay function, which makes the images resemble Blingees.
The workflow is highly customisable, allowing the user to tailor the experience. Even the glitter is customisable!
This workflow remixes the archive, allowing the user to experience it in a different fashion, and transforming it into another experience, rather than just a static folder. The outcome can also be exported as a video, which allows the user to share it further, keeping the archive alive. 

## Getting started: 

Download the file _"C U L8R V1.toe"_; this is a TouchDesiger file, so to run it you will need to [install it](https://derivative.ca/)

You can view a tutorial on how to use _"c u l8r V1"_ [here](https://youtu.be/MY8pdXI6mW4)

## Conclusion: 
This project has reconnected me with my blog’s archive, though the workflow I’ve seen posts I had made ages ago, and surprised myself by remembering the context go many oof them. 
This project has also helped me better understand my relationship with the internet and digital social spaces, I see how things are changing and how that change is affecting online social stages, in some cases for the better, in too many cases for the worse. 

I will definitely use this workflow in the future, it’s fun, easy to use and customisable, with a lot of potential to showcase different things. I would like to share it with those who have had similar online experiences to me, so that they may get to relive their archives.

## Notes on the process: 

This project took a lot of twists and turns, chaining a lot of times. It was going to be a 3d visualiser, it was going to be a game, it was going to be an interactive essay, but in the end it became this, a shareable workflow for visualising accidental archives. 

I did a lot of research into the internet, comparing a lot what we have now vs what we had 20 years ago. This left me with a lot of big feelings; I know I’m coating my perception of the old internet with a thick layer of nostalgia, but at the same time, it does feel like things are shittier now. 
I feel like the internet before was a bit more straightforward? Now everyone is constantly trying to sell you something or grab your attention. 
Especially over the last year or so I’ve seen a significant deterioration on online content itself. There’s so much AI slop everywhere, and I find myself being more hesitant before interacting with something, especially if it’s art. I stop and think, is this real or AI? The place I’ve noticed it the most is with google search, its so bad now. You need to add reddit to all queries, or use a different search engine. 

For this project, I tried to use Google as little as possible for the research-heavy section. Instead, I used a lot of databases, like JSTOR, RefSeek, Google Scholar, WorldCat or DAE’s library catalogue, I also perused a lot of online archives (like the Internet Archive or archive.today). I had a bit of background knowledge already, but having more academic sources that went more in depth was crucial.
