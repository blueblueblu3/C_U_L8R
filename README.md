Overview:

The internet has changed a lot over the last 20 years, becoming a more commercial space ruled by large platforms, aesthetically becoming more homogenous. 
Early social sites (e.g. MySpace or Tumblr) allowed users to fully customise their profiles, giving them another avenue to express themselves. Blingee was a site that allowed users to create their own custom-made gifs, which would then be posted to other sites. 
These sites are slowly disappearing, losing a countless amount of data in the process. For example, last summer Blingee shut down its website, MySpace has been in a broken “read only” mode since 2024 and Tumblr had large staff layoffs on April. 
Contrary to popular belief, these sites, and the digital subcultures born within them, are extremely fragile. Platforms have the power to shut them down and lose all content in an instant. This has inspired users to start archiving their blogs and personal pages. 

 
Using my archive as a case study, I have created a shareable touchdesigner workflow that allows a user to experience their archive in an alternative way, as an audio-visual presentation. The user just has to plug in a folder with their archive (can be composed of images, gifs, video or http sites) and a .mp3 file, the program remixes the rest. 
Taking inspiration form internet content and aesthetics of the 2000s, this workflow remixes and reinvigorates an archive, taking it beyond being a folder in a computer and turns it into an experience.
